New Features:

* Added a button on the settings page to allow you to upload a debug report. This is useful
  when you run into trouble and I need to get a lot of detail about how your system is configured
  and what Seshy thinks is happening.

Bugs fixed:

* None

Known Issues:

* Need better handling around upload failures and retries.
* Need better handling around download failures and retries.
