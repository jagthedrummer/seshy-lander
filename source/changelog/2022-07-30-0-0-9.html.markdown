Initial Release

New Features:

* Basic Logic Pro X support
* Team-based collaboration
* Project Versioning

Known Issues:

* Files that have been removed from a session will "rise from the dead"
if they're still on a collaborators computer when they download a new version.
* The link for downloadig an update isn't very responsive. It doesn't give you
andy indicators that anything is happening. It might be better to open a browser
window to a download page.
* The login form on the desktop app doesn't integrate with password managers.
