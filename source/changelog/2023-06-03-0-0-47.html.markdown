New Features:

* None

Bugs fixed:

* Better handling around upload failures and retries.
* Better support for downloading onto external drives.
* Better support for watched folders on external drives. Previously Seshy would lose track of
  projects on an external drive if you ever started Seshy with the drive detached.
  Then when you reattached the drive Seshy would see the projects agains but would
  think that they were new. Now Seshy will remember the projects and will give you
  an indicator that the local copy is missing. If you reattach the drive Seshy will
  then find the project again and remove the indicator. If your local copy is gone
  for good you can disconnect Seshy from you local copy and then download a new version.
* Fixed a bug related to keeping track of local state when a project is deleted.
