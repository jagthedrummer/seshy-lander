New Features:

* None

Bugs fixed:

* Empty files in a session directory don't break uploads anymore. This would crop
  up particularly with Ableton Live sets when the session was saved while a track
  was armed. Ableton seems to open an empty file to be ready to save the audio.
* If we download a file in a project and the fingerprint doesn't match what we expect
  we blank out the local version so that the download button will reappear, giving you
  at least some indication that it had trouble. This could stand to be robustified.
* The `Backup` directory in Ableton Live projects is now excluded from being uploaded.

Known Issues:

* The login form on the desktop app doesn't integrate with password managers.
* Need better handling around upload failures and retries.
* Need better handling around download failures and retries.
