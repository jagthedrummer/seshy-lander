New Features:

* Some concurrency protection to make sure that only one process at a time can update the project data file.
* Keep a backup of the project data file when we write a new one.
* It's now possible to delete a cloud project even if you still have a local copy. This is handy if you've been bitten by one of the project duplication bugs.

Bugs fixed:

* Better error handling and retries when we encounter a random network error when uploading files.
* Handle the case edge case where you try to download a project that doesn't have any versions yet.
* Better error handling and messaging if we can't save a comment on a version.
