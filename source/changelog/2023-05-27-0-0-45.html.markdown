New Features:

* None

Bugs fixed:

* Sometimes you could get into a weird state where the server thought you were signed
  out but the desktop app thought you should be signed in. When that happened there was
  no obvious indication that anything was wrong, but some things would just seem to stop
  working until you restarted Seshy. Now you should be prompted to sign in if it gets into
  that weird state.
* Previously Seshy would choke if you pointed it at a _very_ large directory full of many
  projects. It would try to make sense of the entire directory all at once and that could
  cause things to get very sluggish, and if the directory was large enough could start causing
  problems for other programs due to Seshy opening too many files at once. Now Seshy will
  only try to read a few files at a time so that it doesn't overwhelm the system.

Known Issues:

* Need better handling around upload failures and retries.
* Need better handling around download failures and retries.
