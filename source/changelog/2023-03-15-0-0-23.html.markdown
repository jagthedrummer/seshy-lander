New Features:

* Addes a new "Settings" screen (under the user menu in the top right) that allows you
  to configure what folder we use as your primary upload/download directory, and allows
  you to add additional folders to watch for new projects.
* The local project data cache is now stored in the normal system `userData` directory
  (usually ~/Library/Application Support/Seshy). Previously it was stored in a hidden
  directory inside `~/Seshy`. The app will take care of moving the old cache to the new spot.
* Seshy will now remember the size and position of the window and will restore them after a restart.

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed a bug where two projects in different directories with the same name would clobber each other.

Known Issues:

* Need better handling around upload failures and retries.
* Need better handling around download failures and retries.
