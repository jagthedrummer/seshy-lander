New Features:

* BETA - A rough prototype of commenting on bounces. Not fully functional, and only available to beta testers.
* Some animations for state changes like menus opening, or toggling of the description editor.

Bugs fixed:

* On mobile the main menu will now auto-close when you tap outside of it.
* On desktop the user menu will now auto-close when you click outside of it.
