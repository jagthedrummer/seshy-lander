New Features:

* Sign in now happens via a browser based auth flow. When you click the "sign in" button in the
  desktop app your browser will open, and if you're already signed in to the web site then you'll
  immediately be returned to the desktop app, and you'll be signed in there as well. If you're not
  already signed in to the web site, you can sign in (using a password manager, if you like!), and
  then you'll be redirected back to the desktop app.

Bugs fixed:

* None

Known Issues:

* Need better handling around upload failures and retries.
* Need better handling around download failures and retries.
