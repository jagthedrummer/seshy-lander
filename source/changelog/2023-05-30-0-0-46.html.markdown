New Features:

* None

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed a bug where Seshy would get confused if you started to delete a project, and then removed it
  from your filesystem outside of Seshy.
* Fixed a bug where Seshy would get confused if a file that it thought it needed to upload disappeared during a sync.
* Previously Seshy would sometimes automatically create a new 0 byte version of a project after you click "download".
  That shouldn't happen anymore.
* Better handling around download failures.
* On Windows some DAWs seem to keep files open and locked, which means that Seshy can't upload them. Previously this
  would fail silently and it would look like everything had uploaded. Now Seshy will mark the project with an error
  and will advise you to close your DAW and then click the "retry upload" button.
