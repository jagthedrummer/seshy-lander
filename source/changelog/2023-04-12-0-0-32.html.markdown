New Features:

* First beta builds for Windows.

Bugs fixed:

* Previously the entire app was draggable, and any click and drag anywhere in the app would
  move the app window. This meant that you couldn't select any text anywhere in the app.
  Now only the top bar is draggable.
* Fixed a visual bug for projects that have been renamed in the cloud.

Known Issues:

* Need better handling around upload failures and retries.
* Need better handling around download failures and retries.
