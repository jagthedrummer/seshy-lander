New Features:

* Basic Ableton Live support
* Visual polish
* Performance enhancements
* Upload fingerprinting - Before uploading a file (an audio clip, for instance)
we calculate a fingerprint for the file and if the version that's uploaded doesn't
match then we fail the upload so it can be tried again. Currently you'd need to quit
and restart Syncbot in order to retry the upload.

Bugs fixed:

* Files that have been removed from a project will no longer "rise from the dead".
* Better handling around prompting to update.

Known Issues:

* The login form on the desktop app doesn't integrate with password managers.
* Need better handling around upload failures and retries.
