New Features:

* Completely rewritten project watching service. Previously if you pointed
  Seshy at a folder that was very big and deep (like hundreds of thousands
  of files) then it would really struggle to make sense of it. And if the
  folder was big enough it would eventually just crash Seshy. Now the watching
  process happens in the background, and is much more selective and respectful
  of system resources. This means that when you point Seshy at a very large
  directory it should now stay responsive instead of getting sluggish or locking
  up. And it should be able to deal with all the projects it finds there instead
  of crashing.

Bugs fixed:

* Fixed a small bug around deleting local projects from within Seshy.
