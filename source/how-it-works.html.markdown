# How Seshy Works

## Seshy is a Desktop application for MacOS & Windows

Seshy is primarily a desktop application.
For now you'll need to use the [web site](https://app.seshy.me/) to create new teams and to invite people to your teams.
But for working with project and collaborating with other people you'll primarily use the app.

Seshy supports the following DAWs:

* Logic Pro X
* Ableton Live
* Avid Pro Tools
* Bitwig Studio

## The desktop app operates on your `~/Seshy` folder

After installing the app it will prompt you to open your <code>Seshy</code> folder.
Then you can drop a session into that folder (or create a new session and save it there)
and then Seshy will automatically upload that project into your "Personal" team.
Which leads us to...
