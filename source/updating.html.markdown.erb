# Updating Syncbot?

## Here's what you should know.

When you're upgrading your Desktop application you should be able to avoid the macOS developer
verification warning if you drag the new version onto the old version and choose "Replace" from
the confirmation that pops up. If you delete the old version first you'll need to do the same
dance as when you first installed.
