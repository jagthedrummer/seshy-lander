# Updating Syncbot?

## Here's what you should know.

When you're upgrading your Desktop application you should be able to avoid the macOS developer
verification warning if you drag the new version onto the old version and choose "Replace" from
the confirmation that pops up. If you delete the old version first you'll need to do the same
dance as when you first installed.

For a smooth upgrade:


* Make sure to quit Syncbot
* Download the zip file containing the app
* Open your 'Downloads' folder in Finder
* Double click the zip file to unzip it
* Drag the Syncbot icon into your 'Applications' folder (or wherever you want to keep it)
* Click the "Replace" button in the confirmation that pops up
* Double click Syncbot to launch it
