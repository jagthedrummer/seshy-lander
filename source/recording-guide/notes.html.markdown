Hey dude! If you already have a workflow for Ableton that you're comfortable
with then I'd expect that you'll be able to do things more or less the same way
in Logic. Logic does now have a "session view" equivalent, but I haven't really
used it at all. I also don't have much experience with the Session Player
stuff. They've had a Session Drummer of that for a while and I've played with
it a time or two but never really DID anything with it. I know some people
who've definitely used it as something to jam against for generating ideas.

I do all my work in the normal timeline mode. My general workflow is something
like this:

Let's say I have an idea for a bass line. I'll usually try to get the tempo by
using the "tap" feature based on whatever speed feels right for the thing.
Maybe tweak it a bit. Then turn on the click and record a fairly minimal pass
at it. Like if I just have an A and B section I'll just record one rough pass
(AB), maybe two (ABAB). At this point the goal is just to capture the idea,
however little of it there may be.

Then I'll use the cycle feature to set that up to loop, and then start drumming
along, just to try to find a pattern or two that works with the bass line. As
I'm doing that I might start to get a feel for the overall "shape" of the song,
and might arrange that manually in the session. To do that I'd split the rough
bass line into sections and then copy paste things around to make the sequence
I want. Maybe something like ABABBAAB or whatever. Or maybe it's as simple as
extending the ABAB pattern to give me a longer bass line to record against.

Once I have a pattern or two that feels good on the drums I'll record a rough
version of whatever I've come up with. (Or maybe instead of drums I'd do a
synth pad, or a melody or whatever. Or I'll do those things after drums.) Again
just trying to capture whatever ideas I have, without yet trying to dictate the
final form.

Once I have a little something down, I'd probably share it with Chris and he'd
kind of do the same thing. Play along with it first just to GET some ideas, and
then record some of those ideas just to capture them.

Sometimes we end up with a heavily layered ABAB pattern, and other times more
structure and progression has already started to emerge. But at some point we
start thinking more about "the structure" than "the legos" and we'll go back to
splitting regions and manually moving things around the session to create
structure. If we have a heavily layered ABAB thing that might look like taking
a few layer out of the first AB section to sketch out a mellow intro, then add
some of the layers back in the next AB pass. Then maybe we take out everything
except the drums to sketch out either a breakdown or a bridge that might be
there. Then add all the layers back in for a final ABB.

It's an iterative process and not really linear. Capture ideas, roughly arrange
them, capture more ideas, roughly arrange that, capture more ideas, etc...

Usually as the structure starts to emerge we'll re-record individual parts to
capture the shape of the song better, so that the energy "flows" correctly.
Like instead of sticking with the copy/pasted ABAB bass line that was
originally hacked together I'll re-record a pass to express the dynamics of the
tune so it's more like abAB. Then maybe more copy/paste arranging, then more
re-recording, then more arranging, etc...

At some point we'll decide "OK, now we've found The Song and now it's time to
Record It". The thing we've Frankensteined together is the prototype, not the
deliverable. We use it as a scaffold and gradually start re-recording all of
the bits, replacing them one by one. Usually that starts with the drums. I'll
mute the rough drums, turn the click way up, turn everything else way down, and
then start recording. I use Logic's "take folder" feature to record multiple
passes at the song and then can piece together the final drums by selecting
between takes for various sections (even down to being able to pick individual
notes).

Then I'll mute the rough bass and record a few passes at bass. Usually doing
the whole song at a time, but sometimes for tricky sections I'll just record
sections individually. The piece together the final bass from all those takes.
Then Chris will start replacing rhythm guitar and piano, and then we'll work up
to the leads and vocals and what not.

Sometimes we come up with new ideas after we've started Recording. And then
there's a little back tracking and sometimes we re-record "final tracks" to
accommodate the new idea and sometimes we ship something with a copy/paste job
on the drums and bass to create and extra breakdown section or whatever. Again
with the iterative non-linear process.

Sometimes as we start to re-record things we decide that the rough take of
something was good enough. Sometimes it's something kind of in the background
like a synth pad, but occasionally we've shipped a "rough solo" just because
Chris happened to be particularly inspired the day he recorded it and it was
just hard to top.

Also, throughout the process, sometime starting very early on, we'll be kind of
low-key "pre-producing" the song in terms of stuff like the overall mix, and
the general "sound stage" for stuff like "the drums should have some big ass
reverb" or "let's hard pan the rhythm guitar right and the piano left".

I also make use of Flex Time and Flex Pitch to tweak the timing and pitch of
notes to tighten things up, pretty frequently during the writing/arranging
phase and definitely a lot more on final tracks.

And with it being an iterative process there are plenty of times that we'll
experiment with something and decide it's not quite working and then try
something else. Sometimes that looks like "the keyboard line kind of clashes
with the vocals in the verse, we should simplify it" and other times it's more
drastic, all the way up to stuff like "I think these two sections might
actually be two different songs and we shouldn't try to cram them into the same
project".


## Outline (kinda...)

* Don't start Recording™ too early, but start recording immediately
* Recording™ often starts with the rhythm section, writing rarely does
* If you're having trouble writing, just go exploring instead (seek out moments of inspiration instead of waiting for it to strike)
* Use the DAW to validate ideas and to experiment with structure
* Build structure by finding things to take away or simplify
* Capture ideas in whatever form you have them (it's OK to start with a riff or a pad)
* Involve collaborators early
* Start with lo-fi sketches and work towards hi-fi
* Early sketches are immagination aids (like a visual aid for your ears) - Don't get discouraged by their lo-fi-ness
* Find what the song wants to be, but also find what you want it to be
* If an idea from a collaborator seems uninstersting, think what you could add to make it more interesting
* High standards are good, but avoid unrealistic expectations
* Elements of a song:
  * Lyrics (Philisophical Ideas)
  * Composition (Musical Ideas)
  * Instrumentation
  * Arrangement
  * Tempo
  * Key
  * Vibe
  * Genre
  * Production Quality/Aesthetics
  * Performance
* What if something "isn't working"?
  * Are there specific elements that aren't Good?
  * Are there disagreements or mismatches or conflicts between some elements?
* It's OK to explore a thing and then let it go.
* It's OK to have an unpublished back catalog
* It's OK to never publish anything if that's not what you want to do

## Illustration Sequences

My friend, [Greg Tatum](https://gregtatum.com), is a talented artist in a number of mediums
and recently he posted a behind-the-scenes look at one of his illustrations. I think it can
serve as a great visual representation for writing and recording music.

Here's the finished illustration:

When Greg posted the finished product he said this:

> I had a very distinct dream the other night about islands floating on a
> planet made of air. The islands were ancient machines with giant gears in
> them. I decided to do a digital painting of it. I'm still learning colors,
> but #procreate is starting to feel a bit more natural to use. I dumped a lot
> of hours into the detail work here.

Often when we start working on music we can have a reasonably clear idea about
what we're hoping to achieve. In thse cases it's similar to having the kind of
artistic inspiration that Greg had from his dream. Greg could probably "see" this
scene in his "minds eye", and sometimes we might be able to "hear" a musical idea
in our "minds ear".

But how do we get from this?

To this?

Take a minute and think about how you'd imagine the process happening.

Think about the order in which things were added.

What was drawn first?

What came after that?

What did the process of "adding the finishing touches" look like?
