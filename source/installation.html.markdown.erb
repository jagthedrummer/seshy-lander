# Installation

## The app can be tricky to open for the first time

Since Syncebot is early in the development cycle it gets flagged by the macOS security checks.
Once we're a little further along this shouldn't be a problem.
In the mean time, here's what you need to do:

<%= partial 'download-button' %>

1. Download the dmg installer file containing the app
1. Open your 'Downloads' folder in Finder
1. Double click the installer to start it
1. Drag the Syncbot icon into your 'Applications' folder
1. Double click the 'Applications' folder to open it
1. In the 'Applications' folder window, right click on the Syncbot application icon to open a pop-up menu (a two-fingered tap on a touch pad)
1. Hold down the 'option' key on your keyboard and click the 'Open' menu item
1. You'll see a warning that macOS cannot verify the developer of Syncbot
1. Click the "Open" button in the warning window

Once you've opened Syncbot for the first time it should continue to open in all the normal ways
(double click, from the Dock, etc...) until the next time you download an update.
