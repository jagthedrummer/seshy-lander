## Seshy is team-based

Seshy is all about collaborating with others, and the way to do that is with a team.

---

We also know that you might want to work on some stuff by yourself,
and that's why you get a "Personal" team that's just for you.

(I know this may seem weird, but it makes a bunch of other stuff easier to think about if you don't
have to mentally juggle the idea of projects sometimes being owned by a person and sometimes being owned by a team.)

---

Whenever you add a project to your <code>Seshy</code> folder it will first go into your "Personal" team.
Each time you save the session Seshy will automatically upload your changes.

When you're ready to share the project with a collaborator you can use the web site to create a new team.

---

Once you've done that you can invite anyone to participate on that team.
(They'll also get a "Personal" team for their own projects.)

Any projects you share with the team will be available to anyone who's on the team.

When your collaborator creates a new project it will start off in their Personal team.
They can share it with the band at any time. (Or not!)

To share a project with a team you can click on the project in the desktop app, then go to the "Teams" tab.
There you'll see a list of all your teams and you'll have the option to share the project with any of them.
