# About the name change

## What all is changing?

Mainly just the name and the domain. Everything will work the same,
and all of your sessions will be safe and sound.

Soon there will be a new version of the Desktop app available that
will have the name change, and will point to new domains.

Once that's available you should upgrade, and then everything should
Just Work.

## Why the change?

Warning: This story is mildly NSFW.

I originally chose the name "Syncbot" because it was one of the first
names I thought of, and I found that the `syncbot.com` domain was just
being squatted on, so I thought that `syncbot.media` would be OK.

A few months later a site popped up at `syncbot.com` selling some sort
of AI assisted masturbatory device and I just decided that it would be
better to not have to disambiguate this project from that one.
