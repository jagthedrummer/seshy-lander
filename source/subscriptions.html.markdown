# Subscriptions

Subscriptions allow you to store a larger volume of projects in Seshy, and they allow you to
have unlimited sized teams. (Within reason. This is a collaboration tool, not a file
distribution service.)

A higher level subscription plan will allow you and your team(s) to store an even larger volume of projects.

Each Subscription is owned by a single Team. Billing Admins for that Team can manage that Subscription.

A single Subscription can be extended to cover multiple Teams via Umbrella Subscriptions.

All Projects that are owned by Teams that are covered by a Subscription
will count towards the storage quota of that Subscription.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to help illustrate how it works.

### Collaborator

If a friend or band mate invites you to contribute to one of their projects it won't cost you anything.

You can download any projects that they share with you, and any changes you make will be automatically shared with them.

If you start a new project you can request to transfer it to your friend or band mate. If they accept the project then it will count towards their storage quota.

The Collaborator plan comes with enough storage that you should be able to have at least a couple of works-in-progress that haven't been handed off yet.

### Solo Artist

This is the simplest scenario, and it's pretty easy. You'd start a subscription
for your Personal team and then projects that you upload would count towards the
project quota for your subscription.

If you want to bring in some collaborators you can start new team, invite them
to join the team, and then share some of your projects with the team.

As a Billing Admin for your Personal team you can upgrade or cancel your subscription
at any time.

If you cancel your subscription then your projects will no longer be available to download
and new changes will not be saved by Seshy.

<!--
### Solo Artist & Side Projects

If you're primarily a solo artist, but you also have some side bands then the subscription
scenario doesn't change all that much.

You'd subscribe to the Seshy "Band" plan under your Personal team and then extend the subscription to
the teams for your side projects. Any projects owned by your side teams would count towards your subscription.

If collaborators in one of your side bands starts a new project they could choose to transfer it to the band team
and then it would count towards your Storage Pool.

### Bands

Bands can be tricky. (And I don't mean just about subscriptions!)

How you handle your subscription depends a lot on how you organize and manage your band.

**Umbrella Subscriptions** allow you to pay for a single subscription, but to cover everyone in the band.

If there's a clear "band leader" type then _maybe_ the subscription is on their Personal
team and they extend the subscription to the band. <!--(A lot like the Solo Artist & Side Project scenario.)-->

![Band Subscription](subscriptions/band.png)

For more... democratic (or professional!) band arrangements you might want to have the main subscription be owned
by the band team. Then several people in the band can be Billing Admins and will be able
to manage the subscription.

You can also extend the subscription to the Personal teams
of any band members that you'd like. (Or maybe they want to have their own subscription
for Reasonsâ„¢. That works too. Or mix and match!)


### Producers

If you're a producer and you're working with many different artist it can be convenient to use the same
workflow with all of them, but some of the people you're working with might not be subscribed to Seshy.

That's where **Umberella Subscriptions** come in. They alow you to extend your storage pool to cover additional
teams, which means that you can get all of your artists to use Seshy without all of them needing to manage
their own subscriptions.

You can create a team for each artist that you work with, and then create an Umbrella Subscription to cover
that team. Then any projects owned by that team will count towards your storage pool.


### Studios

For a studio you'd probaby want to subscribe under a dedicated team just for your studio
staff, or maybe even a team just for your billing/accounting folks.

Then you'd extend that subscription to teams that you want to cover under your subscription.
