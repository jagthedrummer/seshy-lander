    <h1>Seshy Pricing</h1>

    <p>Seshy is a tool for both collaboration and storage of DAW sessions.</p>
    <p>It's always free to collaborate on projects.</p>
    <p>You only pay for storage of projects that you own.</p>
    <p>You can collaborate with others by creating <a href="/teams/">teams</a> and sharing projects with them.</p>
    <p>Teams are free, and you can have as many as you need. (Within reason. This is a collaboration tool, not a file distribution platform.)</p>
    <p>It doesn't cost you anything to contribute to projects that are owned by others.</p>

    <h3>Archiving</h3>

    <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>

    <h3>Contributor</h3>
    <p>If a friend or band mate invites you to contribute to one of their projects it won't cost you anything.</p>
    <p>You can download any projects that they share with you, and any changes you make will be automatically shared with them.</p>
    <p>If you start a new project you can request to transfer it to your friend or band mate. If they accept the project then it will count towards their storage quota.</p>
    <p>The Contributor plan comes with enough storage that you should be able to have at least a couple of works-in-progress that haven't been handed off yet.</p>

    <h3>Solo Artist</h3>
    <p>As a solo artist you might be using Seshy primarily as a backup and archiving tool.</p>
    <p>But you might want to work with some collaborators every now and then.</p>
    <p>When you want to work with someone else, like a guest musician or a mix/master engineer, then you can create a team, invite them to the team, and then share projects with them.</p>
    <p>When your collaborators make any changes to the sessions you've shared with them those changes will be automatically uploaded to Seshy.</p>

    <h3>Band</h3>
    <p>A band might use Seshy for a mix of collaboration and archiving.</p>
    <p>You'd have one team that represents your core band. Any time someone starts a new project they can transfer ownership to the band team.</p>
    <p>Then you might have another team that's the core band plus your mix/master engineer.</p>
    <p>If you wanted to bring in a guest musician for just a track or two, you can create another team for that.</p>

    <h3>Producer</h3>
    <p>A producer might use Seshy for both collaboration and archiving.</p>
    <p>You'd have teams for each artist that you're working with, or for each combination of artists who are all working together.</p>
