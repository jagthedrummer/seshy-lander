# Splice Studio Alternatives

With the recent announcement that [Splice](https://splice.com/) is shutting down their
Studio product many people are looking for alternatives.

Splice Studio was a great service that enabled easy workflows for collaboration on
music projects via the internet.

Unfortunately it had largely been abandoned by Splice, even before the announcement
that it was shutting down. Bugs went un-fixed, and support was hard to come by.

That's why I started building Seshy in early 2022.

My band, [Layer Cake](http://www.layercake.band/), has been using it since the fall
of 2022 and it has completely replaced Splice Studio for us.

Here's a list of ther services that I'm aware of that might be a reasonable alternative. If you
know of something that's not on this list please let me know.

* [Seshy](https://seshy.me/) - I'm planning to focus just on collaboration tools, and won't
  get sidetracked with a beat marketplace or plugin rentals. I'm going to find a pricing structure
  that makes it affordable for musicians while keeping it sustainable for the long term.
* [Blend](https://blend.io/) - Blend offeres backup and collaboration features similar to Splice
  Studio, but it doesn't seem to have a way to restore older versions. The collaboration tools seem
  to be a secondary consideration to their marketplace offerings.

And if you're not really looking for a true alternative, but just something that will do in
a pinch there's always generic cloud services like Dropbox or iCloud.
