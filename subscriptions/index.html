  I'm documenting it ahead of time to gather feedback and to give people a chance to see what to expect soon.

<h1 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h1>

<p>Subscriptions allow you to store a larger volume of projects in Seshy, and they allow you to
have unlimited sized teams. (Within reason. This is a collaboration tool, not a file
distribution service.)</p>

<p>A higher level subscription plan will allow you and your team(s) to store an even larger volume of projects.</p>

<p>Each Subscription is owned by a single Team. Billing Admins for that Team can manage that Subscription.</p>

<p>A single Subscription can be extended to cover multiple Teams via Umbrella Subscriptions.</p>

<p>All Projects that are owned by Teams that are covered by a Subscription
will count towards the storage quota of that Subscription.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Here are a few examples to help illustrate how it works.</p>

<h3 id="contributor">Contributor</h3>

<p>If a friend or band mate invites you to contribute to one of their projects it won't cost you anything.</p>

<p>You can download any projects that they share with you, and any changes you make will be automatically shared with them.</p>

<p>If you start a new project you can request to transfer it to your friend or band mate. If they accept the project then it will count towards their storage quota.</p>

<p>The Contributor plan comes with enough storage that you should be able to have at least a couple of works-in-progress that haven't been handed off yet.</p>

<h3 id="solo-artist">Solo Artist</h3>

<p>This is the simplest scenario, and it's pretty easy. You'd start a subscription
for your Personal team and then projects that you upload would count towards the
project quota for your subscription.</p>

<p><img src="/images/subscriptions/solo.png" alt="Solo" /></p>

<p>If you want to bring in some collaborators you can start new team, invite them
to join the team, and then share some of your projects with the team.</p>

<p>As a Billing Admin for your Personal team you can upgrade or cancel your subscription
at any time.</p>

<p>If you cancel your subscription then your projects will no longer be available to download
and new changes will not be saved by Seshy.</p>

<h3 id="solo-artist--side-projects">Solo Artist &amp; Side Projects</h3>

<p>If you're primarily a solo artist, but you also have some side bands then the subscription
scenario doesn't change all that much.</p>

<p>You'd subscribe to the Seshy "Band" plan under your Personal team and then extend the subscription to
the teams for your side projects. Any projects owned by your side teams would count towards your subscription.</p>

<p><img src="/images/subscriptions/solo_w_side.png" alt="Solo with Side Projects" /></p>

<p>If collaborators in one of your side bands starts a new project they could choose to transfer it to the band team
and then it would count towards your Storage Pool.</p>

<h3 id="bands">Bands</h3>

<p>Bands can be tricky. (And I don't mean just about subscriptions!)</p>

<p>How you handle your subscription depends a lot on how you organize and manage your band.</p>

<p>If there's a clear "band leader" type then <em>maybe</em> the subscription is on their Personal
team and they extend the subscription to the band. (A lot like the Solo Artist &amp; Side Project scenario.)</p>

<p>For more… democratic (or professional!) band arrangements you might want to have the subscription be owned
by the band team. Then several people in the band can be Billing Admins and will be able
to manage the subscription.</p>

<p>You can also extend the subscription to the Personal teams
of any band members that you'd like. (Or maybe they want to have their own subscription
for Reasons™. That works too. Or mix and match!)</p>

<p><img src="/images/subscriptions/band.png" alt="Band Subscription" /></p>

<h3 id="studios">Studios</h3>

<p>For a studio you'd probaby want to subscribe under a dedicated team just for your studio
staff, or maybe even a team just for your billing/accounting folks.</p>

<p>Then you'd extend that subscription to teams that you want to cover under your subscription.</p>
